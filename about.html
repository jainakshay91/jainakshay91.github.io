    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am a passionate researcher with a PhD in Network Engineering from Polytechnic University of Catalunya, where I focused on developing mobility management algorithms for 5G and beyond networks. Prior to that, I received my Master's degree from University of Florida in Electrical and Computer Engineering. Further, I received my Bachelor's degree from SVNIT, Surat, India, in Electronics and Communications Engineering.</p>
    <p>Over the course of my academic career, I've had the privilege of working with some of the brightest minds in the field, including research positions at UPC, NEC Labs and Nokia Bell Labs. I've also contributed to several European projects and have published my work in top-tier conferences and journals.</p>
    <p>One of my most notable projects was developing a signaling protocol to reduce handover preparation time and resources, which was later patented. I'm passionate about using data to drive innovation and solve complex problems, and I'm constantly seeking out new opportunities to make a positive impact.</p>
    <p>Aside from my work, I enjoy running, cooking, playing guitar, and executing hobby projects. I also aspire to be a mentor to several aspiring researchers and engineers, and I'm always looking for ways to give back to the next generation of thinkers and leaders in the field.</p>
    <p>Thank you for taking the time to learn more about me! I hope you'll find my website informative and engaging, and I look forward to connecting with you.</p>
